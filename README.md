# License-Plate-Predictor
A real-time computer vision application built using YOLO and Streamlit that detects vehicle license plates in images and videos. The model is fine-tuned on a custom license plate dataset, achieving high accuracy and fast inference. Users can upload a video through a web interface, and the system automatically detects license plates frame by frame.
